# React Mastery 2025 – Nyanja Edition

I deleted my first repo because I refused to use TypeScript.  
My mentor (a real senior dev) roasted me.  
I listened.  
This is my redemption arc.

Goal: Go from zero to senior-level React engineer under real mentorship.
Current Stage: 0 → Redeemed with TypeScript
